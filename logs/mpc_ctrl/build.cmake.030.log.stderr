  By not providing "FindOsqpEigen.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "OsqpEigen", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "OsqpEigen" with
  any of the following names:

    OsqpEigenConfig.cmake
    osqpeigen-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "OsqpEigen" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "OsqpEigen_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "OsqpEigen" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
